dreb is an open-source terminal coding agent, forked from [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) (itself derived from Claude Code). It has *fewer* features than Claude Code by design — the bet is that a small, hackable core you can shape beats a large feature set you can't.

Claude Code is a great product. dreb isn't trying to compete on features — it's trying to compete on flexibility. The core is kept minimal; what you'd find baked into other tools, you build here with [skills](#skills) (markdown workflows), [extensions](#extensions) (TypeScript), or install from third-party [packages](#packages).

Concretely, dreb ships *without* things Claude Code has — and that's intentional:

- **No MCP.** Build CLI tools with READMEs (see [Skills](#skills)), or build an extension that adds MCP support.
- **No permission popups.** Run in a container, or build your own confirmation flow with [extensions](#extensions).
- **No plan mode.** Write plans to files, or build it with extensions, or install a package.
- **No background bash in the main agent.** The main agent runs commands synchronously. Role-matched parallel work can use the optional `subagent` tool — each subagent runs as an independent process with its own tools.

What you get in exchange: a skill system, an extension API, custom agent definitions, custom provider support (route through any proxy, use any API-compatible backend), and a subagent system for parallel work. From those primitives, you build what you need — and share it with others via git or npm.

## Quick Start

> **Node.js 22 LTS is required.** dreb relies on SSE streaming behavior that is stable in Node 22 LTS. Node 24 and Node 26 are known to break provider streaming due to changes in ReadableStream buffering, which causes every provider to fail with **"request ended without sending any chunks"**. If you see that error, switch to Node 22 LTS.

### Building from source (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aebrer/dreb.git
cd dreb
npm install
npm run build
npm link -w packages/coding-agent
```

---

### Installing from npm

```bash
npm install -g @dreb/coding-agent
```

Authenticate with an API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
dreb
```

Or use your existing subscription:

```bash
dreb
/login  # Then select provider
```

Or use a custom provider (corporate proxy, Bedrock, etc.) — see [Custom providers & models](#providers--models).

Then just talk to dreb. All 13 standard built-in tools are enabled by default (unless `backgroundAgents.maxConcurrentSubagents` is `0`, which removes `subagent` from new parent sessions): `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `subagent`, `wait`, `watch_github_ci`, and `ask_user`. Use `--tools` to restrict to a subset (e.g., `--tools read,grep,find,ls` for read-only). Four additional tools — `search`, `repo_graph`, `skill`, and `tasks_update` — are always active regardless of `--tools`. `suggest_next` is active by default but excluded when `--tools` is specified. The model uses these to fulfill your requests. Add capabilities via [skills](#skills), [prompt templates](#prompt-templates), [extensions](#extensions), or [packages](#packages).

**Also available:** [`@dreb/long-horizon`](../long-horizon/) — a standalone durable supervisor for multi-session autonomous work with planning, recovery, safe rollover, and deterministic acceptance gates (`npm install -g @dreb/long-horizon`). This is broader than auto-compaction continuation and leaves policy outside coding-agent core. [`@dreb/telegram`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dreb/telegram) — run dreb as a Telegram bot with live tool status and visible results for user-facing tools (`npm install -g @dreb/telegram`). [`@dreb/dashboard`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dreb/dashboard) — run `dreb dashboard` for a browser UI with fleet overview, full chat steering, unified dismissible session banners, explicit navigation that preserves viewed closed transcripts as read-only snapshots, a TUI-parity rolling TPS indicator with long-term delta, generic fail-closed built-in slash-command discovery and execution, inline provider/API failures with partial output preserved, sanitized raster tool images plus sent user uploads retained as bounded transcript previews by default, a bounded all-agent subagent panel with drill-in, host file browser, dreb memory editor with exact-revision saves and automatic index cleanup on delete, curated appearance themes with per-browser light/dark mode and font selection (theme default, Google-hosted IBM Plex Mono, or the bundled self-hosted JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Iosevka, OpenDyslexic, and Atkinson Hyperlegible), and resilient Tailscale/rotating-code pairing with a configurable 180-day default and advance expiry warnings (`npm install -g @dreb/dashboard`; see [docs/dashboard.md](docs/dashboard.md)). Tool images cross browser-facing transport as content-addressed references; in dashboard mode each unique image crosses the RPC stdout pipe at most once per child process (later occurrences become references), and browser-local Settings offers placeholders, bounded previews, or informed-opt-in originals, with size disclosure and confirmation above 1 MiB. Full-resolution HTML export remains self-contained. The Memories screen is dreb-only (`~/.dreb/memory` and populated active/on-disk-session project `.dreb/memory`; empty projects are omitted), shows complete indexes with a >200-line warning, opens local index links within the selected scope, replaces stale editor content with visible loading feedback, surfaces malformed entry frontmatter for repair, preserves drafts on conflicts, and does not create/rename entries or expose Claude paths. Compact SSE snapshots update live fleet cards without repeatedly fetching the cross-project inventory, and session drill-in hydrates state, messages, and background agents through one ordered snapshot request. While drill-in remains mounted, authoritative detail refreshes keep its header current, confirmed model/thinking changes are reconciled without stale snapshot rollback, and post-compaction context uses a conservative estimate until fresh provider usage arrives. Terminal provider failures show their reason on fleet cards, while transient failures clear terminal state when automatic retry begins and remain recorded inline on the failed attempt. Its top bar and persistent session header indicators report connecting, connected, retrying, resyncing, disconnected, or auth failed; bounded SSE replay plus an explicit snapshot barrier restores session state, tasks, and image references after a reload, restart, gap, backpressure disconnect, or stalled stream, while authenticated image routes recover bytes separately from authoritative transcripts.

**Platform notes:** [Windows](docs/windows.md) | [Termux (Android)](docs/termux.md) | [tmux](docs/tmux.md) | [Terminal setup](docs/terminal-setup.md) | [Shell aliases](docs/shell-aliases.md)

**Bun users:** Bun's lockfile can cache stale `@dreb/*` versions after upgrades, causing missing-export errors. Fix with `bun pm cache rm && bunx --force dreb`.

### Troubleshooting

- **"request ended without sending any chunks" on every provider** — Your Node version is likely too new. Switch to **Node.js 22 LTS**. Node 26 in particular changed ReadableStream buffering in a way that breaks the Anthropic and OpenAI SDK stream parsers dreb uses.

---

## Providers & Models

For each built-in provider, dreb maintains a list of tool-capable models, updated with every release. Authenticate via subscription (`/login`) or API key, then select any model from that provider via `/model`.

**Subscriptions:**
- OpenAI ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex)
- GitHub Copilot
- Google Gemini CLI
- Google Antigravity
- Kimi For Coding

**API keys:**
- Anthropic
- OpenAI
- Azure OpenAI
- Google Gemini
- Google Vertex
- Amazon Bedrock
- Mistral
- Groq
- Cerebras
- xAI
- OpenRouter
- Vercel AI Gateway
- ZAI
- OpenCode Zen
- OpenCode Go
- Hugging Face
- Kimi For Coding
- MiniMax
- MiniMax (China)

See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md) for detailed setup instructions, including Kimi For Coding notes that distinguish OAuth, API-key, first-party CLI, and Moonshot Open Platform vision support.

**Custom providers & models:** Add providers via `~/.dreb/agent/models.json` if they speak a supported API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), including Bearer-only Anthropic-compatible endpoints. For custom APIs or OAuth, use extensions. See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) and [docs/custom-provider.md](docs/custom-provider.md).

**Reasoning across model switches:** Exact-model signed, encrypted, or redacted reasoning state is replayed unchanged. Structured reasoning is portable only between models that share a provider and the `openai-completions` API when the destination accepts the source's recognized plain field (`reasoning_content`, `reasoning`, or `reasoning_text`). Other readable reasoning is retained as labelled plaintext in `<reformatted-pre-switch-reasoning>` markers with incompatible protocol metadata removed; opaque redacted or encrypted-only state is omitted for incompatible targets. This outbound conversion does not change session history, so switching back can replay the original state unless it was compacted or pruned. Custom models must also share provider identity and compatible API/signature behavior.

## Interactive Mode

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/interactive-mode.png" alt="Interactive Mode" width="600"></p>

The interface from top to bottom:

- **Startup header** - Shows shortcuts (`/hotkeys` for all), loaded AGENTS.md files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions
- **Messages** - Your messages, assistant responses, tool calls and results, notifications, errors, and extension UI
- **Editor** - Where you type; border color indicates thinking level
- **Footer** - Working directory, session name, total token/cache usage, cost, context usage, current model, and rolling tokens-per-second (median TPS with long-term delta)

The editor can be temporarily replaced by other UI, like built-in `/settings` or custom UI from extensions (e.g., a Q&A tool that lets the user answer model questions in a structured format). [Extensions](#extensions) can also replace the editor, add widgets above/below it, a status line, custom footer, or overlays.

### Editor

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |
| Path completion | Tab to complete paths |
| Multi-line | Shift+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal) |
| Images | Ctrl+V to paste (Alt+V on Windows), or drag onto terminal |
| Bash commands | `!command` runs and sends output to LLM, `!!command` runs without sending |

Standard editing keybindings for delete word, undo, etc. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

Transcript content is optimized for copy/paste: assistant prose, code blocks, tool output, bash output, diffs, and subagent/background-agent results use terminal soft-wrap, so selecting from scrollback preserves long logical lines without app-injected hard newlines. Fixed-width chrome such as tables, boxes, overlays, and the footer remains width-constrained.

### Commands

Type `/` in the editor to trigger commands. [Extensions](#extensions) can register custom commands, [skills](#skills) are available as `/skill:name`, and [prompt templates](#prompt-templates) expand via `/templatename`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login`, `/logout` | OAuth authentication |
| `/model` | Switch models |
| `/scoped-models` | Set the ordered model-cycling scope; in dashboard sessions, opens the scoped-models Settings editor for the current project context |
| `/settings` | Thinking level, thinking summaries (adaptive Claude models), theme, message delivery, transport |
| `/resume` | Pick from previous sessions |
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/name <name>` | Set session display name |
| `/session` | Show session info (path, tokens, cost) |
| `/tree` | Jump to any point in the session and continue from there |
| `/fork` | Branch a new session from any user or assistant message (assistant = continue from that answer, user = rewind and re-ask) |
| `/compact [prompt]` | Manually compact context, optional custom instructions |
| `/copy` | Open multi-select message picker to copy any messages to clipboard. Assistant reasoning is excluded by default and offered as a separate, selectable `Thinking` row. |
| `/dream` | Consolidate and prune memories — backs up, merges duplicates, scans sessions for patterns |
| `/export [file]` | Export session to HTML file |
| `/buddy` | Terminal companion — hatch, pet, reroll, set model, or hide. See [docs/buddy.md](docs/buddy.md) |
| `/reload` | Reload keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, and context files (themes hot-reload automatically) |
| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| `/quit`, `/exit` | Quit dreb |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

See `/hotkeys` for the full list. Customize via `~/.dreb/agent/keybindings.json`. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

**Commonly used:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+C | Clear editor |
| Ctrl+C twice | Quit |
| Escape | Cancel/abort |
| Escape twice | Open `/tree` |

| Shift+Tab | Cycle thinking level |
| Ctrl+O | Collapse/expand tool output |
| Ctrl+T | Collapse/expand thinking blocks |

### Message Queue

Submit messages while the agent is working:

- **Enter** queues a *steering* message, delivered after the current assistant turn finishes executing its tool calls
- **Alt+Enter** queues a *follow-up* message, delivered only after the agent finishes all work
- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to editor
- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to editor

On Windows Terminal, `Alt+Enter` is fullscreen by default. Remap it in [docs/terminal-setup.md](docs/terminal-setup.md) so dreb can receive the follow-up shortcut.

Configure delivery in [settings](docs/settings.md): `steeringMode` and `followUpMode` can be `"one-at-a-time"` (default, waits for response) or `"all"` (delivers all queued at once). `transport` selects provider transport preference (`"sse"`, `"websocket"`, or `"auto"`) for providers that support multiple transports.

---

## Sessions

Sessions are stored as JSONL files with a tree structure. Each entry has an `id` and `parentId`, enabling in-place branching without creating new files. See [docs/session.md](docs/session.md) for file format.

### Management

Sessions auto-save to `~/.dreb/agent/sessions/` organized by working directory.

```bash
dreb -c                  # Continue most recent session
dreb -r                  # Browse and select from past sessions
dreb --no-session        # Ephemeral mode (don't save)
dreb --session <path>    # Use specific session file or ID
dreb --fork <path>       # Fork specific session file or ID into a new session
```

### Branching

**`/tree`** - Navigate the session tree in-place. Select any previous point, continue from there, and switch between branches. All history preserved in a single file.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/tree-view.png" alt="Tree View" width="600"></p>

- Search by typing, fold/unfold and jump between branches with Ctrl+←/Ctrl+→ or Alt+←/Alt+→, page with ←/→
- Filter modes (Ctrl+O): default → no-tools → user-only → labeled-only → all
- Press `L` (Shift+L) to label entries as bookmarks

**`/fork`** - Create a new session file by branching from any point in the current conversation. Opens a selector listing every user and assistant message: picking an **assistant** message keeps that response and everything before it (continue from that answer) with an empty editor; picking a **user** message rewinds to before it (dropping it and everything after) and places its text in the editor for re-asking.

**`--fork <path|id>`** - Fork an existing session file or partial session UUID directly from the CLI. This copies the full source session into a new session file in the current project.

### Compaction

Long sessions can exhaust context windows. Compaction summarizes older messages while keeping recent ones.

**Manual:** `/compact` or `/compact <custom instructions>`

**Automatic:** Enabled by default. Triggers on context overflow (recovers and retries) or when approaching the limit (proactive). Configure via `/settings` or `settings.json`. **Continue after auto-compaction** (persisted as `compaction.continueAfterAutoCompaction`) starts another model turn after every successful automatic compaction, even with no queued message. It is off by default and never makes manual `/compact` continue. It is not a durable goal driver: use the standalone [`@dreb/long-horizon`](../long-horizon/) package for persisted rounds, cross-session rollover, recovery, limits, and evidence-gated completion.

Compaction is lossy. The full history remains in the JSONL file; use `/tree` to revisit. Customize compaction behavior via [extensions](#extensions). See [docs/compaction.md](docs/compaction.md) for internals.

### Tab Title

After a few tool calls, dreb auto-generates a terminal tab title describing the session's task — based primarily on your actual request and current-session actions, with branch/repo/cwd used only for disambiguation. Useful when multiple tabs are open. Fires once per session via a background LLM call, and never overwrites an already-named (e.g. resumed) session; failures are surfaced (shown in interactive mode, logged to stderr in RPC mode).

Set `tabTitle.model` to pin the primary call to one exact `provider/model`. When it is absent, resolution remains the Explore `agentModels` override, then Explore agent frontmatter, then the parent session model. A failed call on a selected model retries once with a different parent model. Disable generation, select its model, adjust the trigger threshold, or set a title length target in [settings](docs/settings.md). Dashboard Settings exposes the enable toggle and model picker, including clearing a pinned model back to the automatic Explore route.

```json
{
  "tabTitle": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
    "triggerAfter": 9,
    "maxTitleLength": 60
  }
}
```

## Settings

Use `/settings` to modify common options, or edit JSON files directly:

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.dreb/agent/settings.json` | Global (all projects) |
| `.dreb/settings.json` | Project (overrides global) |

See [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md) for all options. Dashboard Settings re-entry reloads durable global and project settings after flushing pending writes, so it sees external file edits; unreadable, invalid, or failed writes are surfaced as errors rather than showing stale values. Its scoped-models editor provides provider-grouped search, model/provider/all toggles, accessible ordered partial-scope controls, and explicit save/reset on desktop and mobile. Absent `enabledModels` means future-inclusive all models in registry order; saved partial scopes are non-empty ordered canonical references, and editing a legacy pattern scope normalizes it. A selected project context shows effective merged settings, while writes remain global and warn when project settings shadow them. Changes seed new sessions only; `/scoped-models` opens the editor for the current dashboard session cwd. See the [RPC settings contract](docs/rpc.md#get_settings).

---

## Context Files

dreb loads `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) at startup from:
- `~/.dreb/agent/AGENTS.md` (global)
- Parent directories (walking up from cwd)
- Current directory

Use for project instructions, conventions, common commands. All matching files are concatenated.

### Nested context trust

At startup, dreb **always** performs a separate upward scan from its launch cwd and loads matching `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` files there and in parent directories. That initial scan is not lazy nested loading and is **not** controlled by the settings below. A context file in a subdirectory — or in a different repo an agent later visits — is considered only when a tool operates there.

Lazy nested/out-of-cwd context loading is **off by default**. Configure explicit global trusted roots in `~/.dreb/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "trustedFolders": ["~/src/my-company", "/srv/controlled-repos"]
  }
}
```

A trusted root permits lazy loading for that existing directory and all of its descendants. dreb resolves both the root and each tool target through canonical native `realpath` at decision time: relative, missing, non-directory, and broken-symlink roots fail closed; duplicate and nested roots are deduplicated/subsumed. A lexical descendant that symlinks outside the canonical root is therefore **not** trusted. Project `.dreb/settings.json` cannot add, override, or otherwise widen this policy.

- Lazy loading triggers on path-bearing tools (`read`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`) and on `bash` commands that begin with `cd <dir>`.
- It walks from the target toward the applicable ceiling. A trusted root is a hard ceiling; otherwise the session cwd is used for in-tree targets, then the outermost git repo root, then the outermost directory containing a context file.
- Each file is injected at most once per session, including files from the initial upward scan. The paths are realpath-deduplicated. If a triggering `read` or full `cat`/`bat` already returns a context file in full, dreb marks it loaded without adding a duplicate block.
- Auto-loaded text is secret-scrubbed and appended **after** extension `tool_result` transforms, so those transforms intentionally do not see it.
- Main agents and subagents make the same global trust decision. Global trust changes are observed by active processes for **future** lazy loads; already injected content cannot be removed from their conversation.

**Expert trust-all override — prompt-injection warning:** setting `context.autoLoadNested: true` in the **global** `~/.dreb/agent/settings.json` allows lazy loading from any resolvable tool target. This can inject instructions from untrusted or third-party repositories. It is global-only; a project `.dreb/settings.json` cannot enable it. Leave it off and trust only folders you control whenever possible. The Files view shows the effective trust for the directory being viewed and lets you trust a folder or untrust the actual granting root; untrusting an inherited folder removes that root's trust for all of its descendants.

### System Prompt

Replace the default system prompt with `.dreb/SYSTEM.md` (project) or `~/.dreb/agent/SYSTEM.md` (global). Append without replacing via `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`.

For persistent instructions that apply only to one exact provider/model pair, set `systemPrompt` to replace dreb's built-in prompt or `appendSystemPrompt` to append instructions. Put the field directly on a custom `models[]` entry or built-in `modelOverrides` entry in `models.json`, or use `modelSettings` in `settings.json` with a canonical key such as `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`. Configure prompt behavior in only one file for a canonical model: dreb fails loudly instead of applying implicit precedence when both files declare it. Prompt changes apply when the model changes, and `/reload` picks up edits from either file. Explicit session replacements (`--system-prompt`, `SYSTEM.md`, or SDK hooks) take precedence over model replacement; model append instructions still follow the selected base. See [Custom models](docs/models.md#model-configuration) and [Model settings](docs/settings.md#modelsettings).

---

## Memory

dreb has a persistent, file-based memory system. Memory survives across sessions and helps the model recall user preferences, past decisions, project context, and pointers to external resources.

### How it works

Memory is convention-based — no dedicated tool. The system prompt teaches the model the memory format; the model uses the standard `read`, `write`, and `edit` tools to manage memory files. Memory indexes (`MEMORY.md`) are loaded at session start and injected into the system prompt.

### Locations

| Scope | Directory | Loaded |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Global | `~/.dreb/memory/` | Every session |
| Project | `<project-root>/.dreb/memory/` | When working in that project |

Project identity is determined by git repo root. The global memory directory is auto-created on first session; project directories are created on demand by the model.

### Memory entries

Each memory is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: descriptive-name
description: One-line description for relevance matching
type: user-preferences
---

Content of the memory entry.
```

Four types: `user-preferences` (who the user is), `good-practices` (how to approach work), `project` (ongoing work context), `navigation` (pointers to external resources).

### MEMORY.md index

Each memory directory has a `MEMORY.md` file that serves as an index. Only the first 200 lines are loaded at session start — keep it concise:

```markdown
- [User role](user_role.md) — Python dev, generative art background
- [CI parity](feedback_ci_parity.md) — run tsgo --noEmit locally, not just tests
```

### Claude Code compatibility

dreb reads existing Claude Code memory for the current project from `~/.claude/projects/` (read-only), with source labeling and a warning about Claude Code-specific references that may not apply to dreb.

---

## Task Tracking

The `tasks_update` tool lets the model maintain a visible task list during multi-step work. Tasks appear in a TUI panel with status indicators (☐ pending, ⧖ in progress, ☑ completed).

The tool uses a full-replacement model — the model sends the complete task list on each call, no incremental updates. The TUI panel is visible by default and renders when active tasks exist. It auto-hides when the task list is empty or all tasks are completed. Toggle visibility with the `app.tasks.toggle` keybinding (unbound by default, configurable in [keybindings](docs/keybindings.md)). The panel displays up to 10 tasks at a time; overflow shows as "... and N more".

Task tracking is prompt-driven: the system prompt includes guidelines for when to use it (3+ step work), concise titles, and a maximum of 20 tasks.

---

## Subagents

The optional `subagent` tool runs focused, role-matched work in independent child agent processes. Each subagent runs in its own process with its own context window, and notifies the parent when complete. In the dashboard, a live child's transcript view can accept the user's own steering messages directly; repeated messages use that child's configured one-at-a-time or all-at-once steering queue. Completed and rehydrated transcripts remain read-only.

When `agent` is omitted, dreb selects the default `Explore` agent. Explore retrieves concrete, bounded evidence: files, symbols, documentation, call sites, exact snippets, tests for a named behavior, and explicitly named data flows. The primary agent must synthesize that evidence and owns root-cause diagnosis, ambiguous-requirement interpretation, architecture/design decisions, implementation recommendations, planning, and final conclusions.

Good Explore requests ask it to locate every renderer of a named component, enumerate call sites, quote collection-limiting code, or find documented examples. Do not ask Explore to investigate a root cause, decide ambiguous behavior, recommend an implementation, design a refactor, or produce a plan. Parallel and chain execution do not change role fit; specialized agents remain available for the broader work described by their own definitions.

**Modes:**
- **Single** (`task`): One background agent
- **Parallel** (`tasks`): Up to 8 agents per call, with `backgroundAgents.maxConcurrentSubagents` running at a time (default 4)
- **Chain** (`chain`): Sequential pipeline where each step can reference the previous step's output via `{previous}`

Set `backgroundAgents.maxConcurrentSubagents` in `/settings`, dashboard Settings, or `settings.json` to control the concurrency of newly started parent sessions. A value of `0` removes the `subagent` tool from new parents and adds explicit system-prompt guidance that the parent must perform normally delegated work itself.

**Agent type and override inheritance:** The top-level `agent` parameter is inherited by parallel tasks and chain steps that don't specify their own. Precedence: per-task `agent` > top-level `agent` > default (`"Explore"`). The `model` and optional `thinking` parameters follow the same per-task-over-top-level inheritance. Explicit thinking accepts `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`; unsupported levels for the resolved model fail before spawn. Omit `thinking` to preserve the child's normal settings/default behavior.

**Agent definitions** live in `~/.dreb/agents/` (global) and `.dreb/agents/` (project). Each is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter specifying `name`, `model` (with provider fallback list), and optional `systemPrompt`. Built-in agents include `Explore` (concrete evidence retrieval with no implementation work), `Sandbox` (restricted to `/tmp`), `feature-dev` (strong-tier coding), and several review agents.

**Model availability probes:** When an agent definition specifies a fallback list (comma-separated models), each model is verified with a lightweight API call via the same `streamSimple` path the agent loop uses before the subagent is spawned. The probe uses normal coding-agent thinking defaults and does not pass a synthetic `maxTokens` override, which keeps the request shape representative for reasoning models as well as non-reasoning models. Models that fail the probe (rate limit, quota exhaustion, auth failure, timeout) are skipped with a loud log line, and the next fallback is tried. If all configured models fail, the parent session's model is used as a last resort. Per-invocation model overrides and single-model configs skip probing entirely.

**Per-agent model overrides:** The model used by each agent type can be overridden via the `agentModels.models` setting (a map of agent name → ordered fallback list) without copying or editing the agent definition `.md` files. Configure it in `settings.json` or via `/settings` → **Agent Models**. Resolution order: per-invocation `model` override → `agentModels` setting → agent definition `model` → parent session model. See [docs/agent-models.md](docs/agent-models.md).

**Optional Dispatch Arbiter:** A global-only `subagentArbiter` setting can enable a fully headless, direct model call after the proposal above resolves but before each child process spawns. It uses the validated routing guide, live explicit model scope, and bounded title-setter-style parent activity including useful tool outputs; existing secret scrubbing applies before inference. It may change only the existing agent type, exact scoped provider/model, and supported thinking level. It has no tools, cannot rewrite the task/cwd or agent definitions, and fails closed on configuration, guide, scope, inference, output, or validation errors. It runs once per single/parallel child and after `{previous}` substitution for every chain step. Interactive `/settings` and dashboard Settings both expose enable/disable, exact model selection, thinking, guide path, and loud readiness/validation feedback. Safe typed changed/unchanged/failure records are persisted outside parent model context and relayed to the TUI, JSON/RPC, and dashboard. See [Dispatch Arbiter](docs/agent-models.md#dispatch-arbiter) and [settings](docs/settings.md#dispatch-arbiter).

**Model identity in system prompt:** The parent session's running model is exposed in its own system prompt as `You are running on: provider/id`. This lets the model make self-aware routing decisions (e.g. delegate vision tasks to a multimodal subagent, or use a differently-architected model as a critic). The line updates automatically on mid-session model switches.

**Session and event metadata:** Each child process records its agent type in the session JSONL header (`agentType` field), providing an audit trail of which agent definition executed the work. Child `agent_start`, subagent results, and `background_agent_end` also expose the canonical resolved `provider/model` and effective thinking level, including defaults used when no override was supplied. Chain completion events expose ordered per-step metadata because steps may use different models or thinking levels. Enabled arbiter attempts add a separate `subagent_arbitration` event with proposed/final routes, changed fields, status, optional chain step, and safe host error metadata; raw prompts, responses, and reasoning are never included.

**Background-agent guardrail:** Background subagents run asynchronously and return control to you while they work. To stop the parent agent from spinning ahead of results, a guardrail pauses it after `backgroundAgents.parentTurnLimit` turns (default 3) while subagents are still running. When this happens, dreb surfaces a friendly, non-error notification in the TUI and Telegram — explaining that background agents are still working and the parent paused intentionally, and that it resumes when they report back or when you send a message to steer it. This is a frontend/session event, not a model-context steer, so it can't go stale. Set `backgroundAgents.parentTurnGuardrail` to `false` to let the parent run unbounded while subagents work, or raise `parentTurnLimit` to relax the guardrail. See [settings](docs/settings.md#background-agents).

### Waiting for GitHub CI

Use `watch_github_ci` to monitor pull-request checks without asking the user to return later or constructing a polling loop. It runs `gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast`, defaults to the pull request for the current branch, accepts an optional PR number/URL/branch, and returns when checks pass or definitively fail. After the watch completes, it makes a plain `gh pr checks` query so the model receives one clean final check listing rather than the repeated polling snapshots shown in live progress. The call is cancellable and requires an installed, authenticated [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

The separate `wait` tool is an immediate no-op used when explicitly told to wait or while background subagents are running. It does not monitor CI and must not be used as a sleep or delay.

---

## Semantic Search

The `search` tool provides natural language queries over the codebase using embeddings and full-text search. It supports identifier queries (e.g., `AuthMiddleware`), natural language (e.g., `where is rate limiting handled`), and path queries (e.g., `src/auth/`).

**Parameters:** `query` (required), `searchDir` (directory to index and search — each unique value gets its own independent index; defaults to the enclosing Git root, or cwd outside Git; set it explicitly in Telegram sessions where cwd is `~/`), `restrictToDir` (filter results to files under this subdirectory within the already-built index — does not affect which files are indexed), `limit` (max results, default 20), `rebuild` (force a clean re-index when results look stale or corrupt).

**How it works:** When a top-level dreb process starts in a Git repository, it builds or incrementally refreshes the structural project index without generating embeddings. The first semantic query adds any missing embeddings; subsequent queries reuse the cached index and refresh changed files by mtime. Each explicit `searchDir` gets its own independent index.

**Indexing pipeline:**
- AST-aware code chunking via tree-sitter (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++, GDScript) — extracts functions, classes, methods, and exports as individual chunks
- Format-aware text chunking for non-code files (Markdown by heading, YAML/JSON/TOML by top-level key)
- Local embeddings via all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (~23MB model, auto-downloaded on first use, cached at `~/.dreb/agent/models/`)

**Ranking:** Uses POEM (Pareto-Optimal Embedding-based Multiranking) with 6 metrics: FTS5 BM25, vector cosine similarity, path match, symbol match, import graph proximity, and git recency. Short identifier queries bias toward exact text matches; long natural language queries bias toward vector similarity.

### Repository dependency graph

The `repo_graph` tool exposes bounded traversal of the same index's static file-import relationships. Before a top-level dreb session starts in a Git repository, Dreb automatically prepares this structural index and reports startup progress on stderr; subagents reuse the on-disk index instead of repeating the scan. Supply a repository-relative `file`, optional `direction` (`dependencies`, `dependents`, or `both`), `depth` (1–3), `limit` (1–100), `searchDir`, and `rebuild`. Without an explicit `searchDir`, traversal uses the enclosing Git root. Results are breadth-first and identify the preceding file for each relationship; mutual imports in `both` mode are labeled `imports_and_imported_by`. Structural indexing does not generate embeddings; a later semantic search fills missing vectors on demand.

This is navigation evidence, not a call graph or runtime proof. Dynamic imports, reflection, generated code, framework wiring, and unresolved aliases may be absent. Verify behavior in source and tests.

**Storage:** Project index at `.dreb/index/`, memory files indexed alongside code. Add `**/.dreb/` to your project's `.gitignore`. Works offline after the initial model download.

**Requirements:** Node.js 22+ (uses built-in `node:sqlite`). On older Node versions the tool is silently unavailable — no crash, it simply doesn't register. Zero native addons — uses `web-tree-sitter` (WASM) and `@huggingface/transformers` (WASM).

## Customization

### Prompt Templates

Reusable prompts as Markdown files. Type `/name` to expand.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.dreb/agent/prompts/review.md -->
Review this code for bugs, security issues, and performance problems.
Focus on: {{focus}}
```

Place in `~/.dreb/agent/prompts/`, `.dreb/prompts/`, or a [package](#packages) to share with others. See [docs/prompt-templates.md](docs/prompt-templates.md).

### Skills

On-demand capability packages following the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io). Invoke via `/skill:name`, or the agent invokes them automatically via the built-in `skill` tool when a task matches.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.dreb/agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md -->
---
name: my-skill
description: Use this skill when the user asks about X.
argument-hint: "<topic>"
---

## Steps
1. Do this with $1
2. Then that
```

Skills support [content substitution](docs/skills.md#content-substitution) (`$1`, `$ARGUMENTS`, `${DREB_SKILL_DIR}`, etc.) and frontmatter fields like `argument-hint`, `user-invocable`, and `disable-model-invocation`.

Place in `~/.dreb/agent/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `.dreb/skills/`, or `.agents/skills/` (from `cwd` up through parent directories) or a [package](#packages) to share with others. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md).

dreb ships with **mach6** — a built-in development workflow (issue → plan → push → review → fix → publish) that uses GitHub as shared memory and multi-agent code review. See [docs/mach6.md](docs/mach6.md).

It also ships with the explicitly invoked **`model-routing-guide`** skill. Pass comma-separated model patterns as arguments, or run it without arguments to use the effective non-empty `enabledModels` array. Prefix either form with `update` to diff an existing guide against the resolved scope, preserve retained entries, remove stale ones, and research newly added models instead of rebuilding everything. Those are its only scope sources: it cannot discover a session's runtime `--models` value, so pass those same patterns explicitly when that is the intended scope. It researches canonical provider/model candidates, external evidence, and sanitized aggregate subagent history, then validates and writes `~/.dreb/agent/model-routing-guide.md` atomically. The optional global Dispatch Arbiter consumes the guide only when its exact coverage matches the live explicit scope. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md#model-routing-guide) and [docs/agent-models.md](docs/agent-models.md#dispatch-arbiter).

### Extensions

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/doom-extension.png" alt="Doom Extension" width="600"></p>

TypeScript modules that extend dreb with custom tools, commands, keyboard shortcuts, event handlers, and UI components.

```typescript
export default function (dreb: ExtensionAPI) {
  dreb.registerTool({ name: "deploy", ... });
  dreb.registerCommand("stats", { ... });
  dreb.on("tool_call", async (event, ctx) => { ... });
}
```

**What's possible:**
- Custom tools (or replace built-in tools entirely)
- Plan mode and custom agent workflows
- Custom compaction and summarization
- Permission gates and path protection
- Custom editors and UI components
- Status lines, headers, footers
- Git checkpointing and auto-commit
- SSH and sandbox execution
- MCP server integration
- Make dreb look like Claude Code
- Games while waiting (yes, Doom runs)
- ...anything you can dream up

Place in `~/.dreb/agent/extensions/`, `.dreb/extensions/`, or a [package](#packages) to share with others. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [examples/extensions/](examples/extensions/).

### Themes

Built-in: `dark`, `light`. Themes hot-reload: modify the active theme file and dreb immediately applies changes.

Place in `~/.dreb/agent/themes/`, `.dreb/themes/`, or a [package](#packages) to share with others. See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md).

### Packages

Bundle and share extensions, skills, prompts, and themes via npm or git.

> **Note:** Third-party packages can include extensions (arbitrary code) and skills (model instructions). Skim what you're installing, same as any other dependency.

```bash
dreb install npm:@foo/my-tools
dreb install npm:@foo/my-tools@1.2.3      # pinned version
dreb install git:github.com/user/repo
dreb install git:github.com/user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
dreb install git:git@github.com:user/repo
dreb install git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
dreb install https://github.com/user/repo
dreb install https://github.com/user/repo@v1      # tag or commit
dreb install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo
dreb install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo@v1    # tag or commit
dreb remove npm:@foo/my-tools
dreb uninstall npm:@foo/my-tools          # alias for remove
dreb list
dreb update                               # skips pinned packages
dreb config                               # enable/disable extensions, skills, prompts, themes
```

Packages install to `~/.dreb/agent/git/` (git) or global npm. Use `-l` for project-local installs (`.dreb/git/`, `.dreb/npm/`). If you use a Node version manager and want package installs to reuse a stable npm context, set `npmCommand` in `settings.json`, for example `["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]`.

Create a package by adding a `dreb` key to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-dreb-package",
  "keywords": ["dreb-package"],
  "dreb": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"]
  }
}
```

Without a `dreb` manifest, dreb auto-discovers from conventional directories (`extensions/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `themes/`).

See [docs/packages.md](docs/packages.md).

## Programmatic Usage

### SDK

```typescript
import { AuthStorage, createAgentSession, ModelRegistry, SessionManager } from "@dreb/coding-agent";

const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  authStorage: AuthStorage.create(),
  modelRegistry: new ModelRegistry(authStorage),
});

await session.prompt("What files are in the current directory?");
```

See [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) and [examples/sdk/](examples/sdk/). `createAgentSession()` runs one SDK-managed conversation; it does not autonomously persist or drive a goal across fresh sessions. For that policy layer, use [`@dreb/long-horizon`](../long-horizon/).

### RPC Mode

For non-Node.js integrations, use RPC mode over stdin/stdout:

```bash
dreb --mode rpc
```

RPC mode uses strict LF-delimited JSONL framing. Clients must split records on `\n` only. Do not use generic line readers like Node `readline`, which also split on Unicode separators inside JSON payloads.

See [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md) for the protocol.

---

## CLI Reference

```bash
dreb [options] [@files...] [messages...]
```

### Package Commands

```bash
dreb install <source> [-l]     # Install package, -l for project-local
dreb remove <source> [-l]      # Remove package
dreb uninstall <source> [-l]   # Alias for remove
dreb update [source]           # Update packages (skips pinned)
dreb list                      # List installed packages
dreb config                    # Enable/disable package resources
```

### Modes

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| (default) | Interactive mode |
| `-p`, `--print` | Print response and exit |
| `--mode json` | Output all events as JSON lines (see [docs/json.md](docs/json.md)) |
| `--mode rpc` | RPC mode for process integration (see [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md)) |
| `--export <in> [out]` | Export session to HTML |

In print mode, dreb also reads piped stdin and merges it into the initial prompt:

```bash
cat README.md | dreb -p "Summarize this text"
```

### Model Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--provider <name>` | Provider (anthropic, openai, google, etc.) |
| `--model <pattern>` | Model pattern or ID (supports `provider/id` and optional `:<thinking>`) |
| `--api-key <key>` | API key (overrides env vars) |
| `--thinking <level>` | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| `--models <patterns>` | Comma-separated patterns for model cycling |
| `--list-models [search]` | List available models |

`max` is a separate native effort currently supported by GPT-5.6 (including Sol, Terra, and Luna); `xhigh` remains available independently. Codex `ultra` is not a provider effort: it combines `max` with client-side multi-agent orchestration, so dreb does not send `ultra` as a raw value.

### Session Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-c`, `--continue` | Continue most recent session |
| `-r`, `--resume` | Browse and select session |
| `--session <path>` | Use specific session file or partial UUID |
| `--fork <path>` | Fork specific session file or partial UUID into a new session |
| `--session-dir <dir>` | Custom session storage directory |
| `--no-session` | Ephemeral mode (don't save) |

### Tool Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--tools <list>` | Comma-separated list of tools to enable (default: all) |
| `--no-tools` | Disable all standard built-in tools (always-active and extension tools still work) |

Available standard tools: `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `subagent`, `wait`, `watch_github_ci`, `ask_user`

`ask_user` pauses the turn and asks you one or more structured clarifying questions in a single call — batched together and answered as one wizard. Each question has Markdown-formatted question text, optional 2-4 multiple-choice options (single- or multi-select), and a "type your own answer" field — rendered natively in the TUI and the Dashboard, and over RPC. Submitting sends the whole batch of structured answers back at once; choosing **Stop agent** or pressing `Esc` aborts the whole current turn rather than continuing without an answer. Options must contain nonblank text. When a question has no options its free-text field is always shown, so every question is answerable. Unanswered questions come back flagged as skipped rather than blocking the turn. An optional `timeoutSeconds` auto-stops the turn after the given number of seconds with a live countdown on every surface; recovered Dashboard sessions retain the original deadline rather than restarting it. Tool abort, timeout, host teardown, and headless/no-UI modes settle cleanly, so the agent never deadlocks waiting on an absent user. UI or response-protocol failures remain distinct from question closure. In the TUI: `↑`/`↓` move between questions, their options, and the free-text fields, `Space` toggles a checkbox (multi-select), `Enter` submits the batch, and `Esc` stops the turn. In the Dashboard: native radios/checkboxes plus a text field per question, an in-card **Stop agent** button that remains accessible on mobile, and `Esc` to stop.

Four additional tools are always active and don't need to appear in `--tools`:
- `search` — semantic codebase search
- `repo_graph` — bounded static file-import traversal
- `skill` — invokes [skills](#skills) programmatically
- `tasks_update` — session [task tracking](#task-tracking) with TUI panel

`suggest_next` is active by default, but specifying `--tools` excludes it so restricted and subagent sessions cannot end their turn with a command suggestion.

### Resource Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-e`, `--extension <source>` | Load extension from path, npm, or git (repeatable) |
| `--no-extensions` | Disable extension discovery |
| `--skill <path>` | Load skill (repeatable) |
| `--no-skills` | Disable skill discovery |
| `--prompt-template <path>` | Load prompt template (repeatable) |
| `--no-prompt-templates` | Disable prompt template discovery |
| `--theme <path>` | Load theme (repeatable) |
| `--no-themes` | Disable theme discovery |

Combine `--no-*` with explicit flags to load exactly what you need, ignoring settings.json (e.g., `--no-extensions -e ./my-ext.ts`).

### Other Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--system-prompt <text>` | Replace default prompt (context files and skills still appended) |

```

### Examples

```bash

# Limit model cycling
dreb --models "claude-*,gpt-4o"

# Read-only mode
dreb --tools read,grep,find,ls -p "Review the code"
