# mach6-plan — Plan, Branch, and Open PR

**User input:** $ARGUMENTS

This command is strictly for **planning**. Do NOT implement any code changes — no file edits, no file writes.

## Global Rules

1. **GitHub as shared memory** — Plans, reviews, assessments, and progress are posted as PR/issue comments so any future session can pick up context.
2. **HTML markers** — Use `<!-- mach6-plan -->` as the first line of plan comment bodies for reliable discovery.
3. **No `#N` in comment bodies** — GitHub auto-links `#N` to issues/PRs. Use "finding 3", "item 3", "stage 2" etc. instead.
4. **Safe git** — Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`. Stage files by name. Never stage secrets.
5. **Task tracking** — Use the `tasks_update` tool to show progress through multi-step commands.
6. **Project conventions** — Check for CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .dreb/CONTEXT.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md before planning.
7. **Non-interactive `gh`** — Set `GH_PAGER=cat` and `GH_EDITOR=cat` before all `gh` commands to prevent interactive prompts from hanging the agent. Use `--body-file` instead of inline `--body` for all `gh pr comment`, `gh pr create`, and `gh issue create` calls to avoid shell interpretation of backticks. Write each body to a **unique per-invocation temp file** via `mktemp` (e.g. `GH_BODY="$(mktemp /tmp/gh-comment.$$.XXXXXXXX)"`) — never a fixed path like `/tmp/gh-comment.md`, which concurrent mach6 sessions on the same machine would clobber, cross-posting one session's body to another's PR/issue.

## Optional `context_mode` routing boundary

`context_mode` is available only through the optional, separately installed `dreb-context-mode` package. This guidance is advisory, not universal deterministic interception.

1. Start code discovery with `search`.
2. Use native tools for expected output of ≤2 KB; for 2–5 KB unless the work is clearly analytical; and for edits, verbatim, exact, or ordered facts, and Git/CI/version/release/publish evidence.
3. Use `context_mode` only for precise, large derived analysis or broad gathers expected to exceed 5 KB.
4. Treat its output as derived, not proof: directly verify material claims against source or bounded native evidence.
5. On an unavailable or failed call, show a bounded visible diagnostic, then continue natively; never silently fall back or report partial protocol output as success.
6. Never invoke `ctx_*` directly, arbitrary MCP methods, or a generic MCP client in core.
7. RTK is rejected due to fidelity, exit-code, and actionable-diagnostic failures.

**Plan-stage limit:** use `context_mode` only for large generated output, configuration, file, or log analysis; keep planning decisions and direct source evidence native.

## Required child handoff

When launching a child, repeat the routing boundary above and provide the exact task, a bounded file set or claim set, required direct verification, validation commands, and completion criteria. The child must use no direct `ctx_*` calls, arbitrary MCP methods, or a generic MCP client in core.

## Step 1: Set up task tracking

```
tasks_update([
  { id: "read", title: "Read issue and context", status: "in_progress" },
  { id: "explore", title: "Explore codebase", status: "pending" },
  { id: "plan", title: "Draft implementation plan", status: "pending" },
  { id: "branch", title: "Create branch and draft PR", status: "pending" },
  { id: "post", title: "Post plan to PR", status: "pending" }
])
```

## Step 2: Read the issue

```bash
gh issue view <number>
gh issue view <number> --comments
```

Parse everything: problem statement, constraints, requirements, acceptance criteria, prior discussion, any existing assessment comments (look for `<!-- mach6-assessment -->`).

Update task: read → completed, explore → in_progress.

## Step 3: Read project conventions

Check for and read (first found):
- CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, .github/CONTRIBUTING.md
- CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .dreb/CONTEXT.md

Extract planning-relevant guidance: project layers, testing expectations, coding conventions.

## Step 4: Explore the codebase

Launch 2-3 Explore subagents in parallel for concrete evidence retrieval. Agent definitions specify their own model with a provider fallback list — defaults work across providers and are fine for most cases. Override only with good reason (e.g. a particularly large codebase requires inspecting many files).
- **Existing feature evidence**: Locate named related features and quote the exact implementation and test snippets that establish their patterns
- **Layer inventory**: Enumerate the files, symbols, imports, and calls in an explicitly named existing data flow without deciding the architecture
- **Integration evidence**: Enumerate concrete call sites, registrations, configuration, and documentation for the relevant symbols

Do not ask Explore to diagnose the problem, interpret ambiguous requirements, recommend an implementation, design the architecture, or produce the plan. Include project conventions in each agent's context. Each agent returns 5-10 key files with bounded evidence. Read all identified files, then have the primary agent synthesize the architecture, risks, and implementation plan.

Update task: explore → completed, plan → in_progress.

## Step 5: Draft the plan

Create an implementation plan with:
- Clear analysis of the problem
- **Deliverables**: What will be produced (be specific)
- **Acceptance criteria**: How to verify the work is done
- **Files to create or modify**: List each with what changes
- **Testing approach**: What tests to write, what to verify
- **Risks and open questions**: Anything that might derail implementation

The plan should be **high-level on implementation details** (avoid cascading spec errors from over-specifying) but **specific on deliverables and acceptance criteria**.

**Project-layer coverage:** Cross-check the plan against discovered project layers. Every affected layer should be addressed.

**Test coverage is mandatory, not optional.** Every new behavior, command handler, formatting function, or event wiring must include tests in the plan. If the target package lacks test infrastructure, the plan must include setting it up as a deliverable — this cannot be deferred. The testing approach should specify:
- Which test files to create or modify
- What behaviors to verify (happy paths, error paths, edge cases)
- What test infrastructure/helpers are needed (mocks, factories, fixtures)

Present the plan to the user. Discuss and revise if they have feedback.

Update task: plan → completed, branch → in_progress.

## Step 6: Create branch and draft PR

```bash
# Derive branch name from issue
# Format: feature/issue-<N>-<slug> (slug = 3-5 words from title, lowercase, hyphens)
git checkout -b feature/issue-<N>-<slug>

# Create an empty commit so the PR can be opened
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: open PR for issue <N>"

git push -u origin feature/issue-<N>-<slug>

# Open draft PR
GH_BODY="$(mktemp /tmp/gh-body.$$.XXXXXXXX)"
cat > "$GH_BODY" << 'MACH6_EOF'
Closes #<N>

<brief description>

Implementation plan posted as a comment below.
MACH6_EOF
gh pr create --draft --title "<title>" --body-file "$GH_BODY"
```

Update task: branch → completed, post → in_progress.

## Step 7: Post plan to PR

```bash
GH_BODY="$(mktemp /tmp/gh-comment.$$.XXXXXXXX)"
cat > "$GH_BODY" << 'MACH6_EOF'
<!-- mach6-plan -->
## Implementation Plan

<full plan content>

---
*Plan created by mach6*
MACH6_EOF
gh pr comment <pr-number> --body-file "$GH_BODY"
```

Update task: post → completed.

Suggest next step: implement the plan, then `/skill:mach6-push` when ready.
