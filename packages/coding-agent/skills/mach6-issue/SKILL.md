# mach6-issue — Assess or Create Issue

**User input:** $ARGUMENTS

## Global Rules

1. **GitHub as shared memory** — Plans, reviews, assessments, and progress are posted as PR/issue comments so any future session can pick up context.
2. **HTML markers** — Use `<!-- mach6-assessment -->`, `<!-- mach6-plan -->`, `<!-- mach6-review -->`, `<!-- mach6-progress -->` as the first line of comment bodies for reliable discovery.
3. **No `#N` in comment bodies** — GitHub auto-links `#N` to issues/PRs. Use "finding 3", "item 3", "stage 2" etc. instead.
4. **Safe git** — Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`. Stage files by name. Never stage secrets (.env, credentials, tokens, keys).
5. **Task tracking** — Use the `tasks_update` tool to show progress through multi-step commands.
6. **Project conventions** — Check for CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .dreb/CONTEXT.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md before planning or implementing.
7. **Non-interactive `gh`** — Set `GH_PAGER=cat` and `GH_EDITOR=cat` before all `gh` commands to prevent interactive prompts from hanging the agent. Use `--body-file` instead of inline `--body` for all `gh pr comment`, `gh pr create`, and `gh issue create` calls to avoid shell interpretation of backticks. Write each body to a **unique per-invocation temp file** via `mktemp` (e.g. `GH_BODY="$(mktemp /tmp/gh-comment.$$.XXXXXXXX)"`) — never a fixed path like `/tmp/gh-comment.md`, which concurrent mach6 sessions on the same machine would clobber, cross-posting one session's body to another's PR/issue.

## Optional `context_mode` routing boundary

`context_mode` is available only through the optional, separately installed `dreb-context-mode` package. This guidance is advisory, not universal deterministic interception.

1. Start code discovery with `search`.
2. Use native tools for expected output of ≤2 KB; for 2–5 KB unless the work is clearly analytical; and for edits, verbatim, exact, or ordered facts, and Git/CI/version/release/publish evidence.
3. Use `context_mode` only for precise, large derived analysis or broad gathers expected to exceed 5 KB.
4. Treat its output as derived, not proof: directly verify material claims against source or bounded native evidence.
5. On an unavailable or failed call, show a bounded visible diagnostic, then continue natively; never silently fall back or report partial protocol output as success.
6. Never invoke `ctx_*` directly, arbitrary MCP methods, or a generic MCP client in core.
7. RTK is rejected due to fidelity, exit-code, and actionable-diagnostic failures.

**Issue-stage limit:** use `context_mode` only to derive a bounded packet from genuinely large issue evidence; keep issue creation, issue text, comments, and bounded assessment evidence native.

## Required child handoff

When launching a child, repeat the routing boundary above and provide the exact task, a bounded file set or claim set, required direct verification, validation commands, and completion criteria. The child must use no direct `ctx_*` calls, arbitrary MCP methods, or a generic MCP client in core.

## Determine Mode

If the input is a number, run **ASSESS** mode. Otherwise, run **CREATE** mode.

## ASSESS Mode

**Assess an existing GitHub issue — explore the codebase, identify scope/risks/ambiguities, post assessment.**

### Step 1: Set up task tracking

```
tasks_update([
  { id: "read", title: "Read issue and comments", status: "in_progress" },
  { id: "explore", title: "Explore relevant codebase", status: "pending" },
  { id: "assess", title: "Analyze and assess", status: "pending" },
  { id: "post", title: "Post assessment", status: "pending" }
])
```

### Step 2: Read the issue

```bash
gh issue view <number>
gh issue view <number> --comments
```

Parse: problem statement, constraints, requirements, acceptance criteria, prior discussion, linked PRs.

Update task: read → completed, explore → in_progress.

### Step 3: Explore the codebase

Launch 2-3 Explore subagents in parallel for concrete evidence retrieval. Agent definitions specify their own model with a provider fallback list — defaults work across providers and are fine for most cases. Override only with good reason (e.g. a large repository requires inspecting many files).
- **Relevant code evidence**: Locate named related behavior and quote the exact implementation and test snippets
- **Flow inventory**: Enumerate files, symbols, imports, calls, and registrations in an explicitly named existing flow without diagnosing it
- **Prior-work evidence**: Locate related branches, PRs, commits, and documentation and report their exact references

Do not ask Explore to determine the root cause, interpret ambiguous requirements, recommend an implementation, decide architecture, or assess the issue. Each agent should return 5-10 key files with bounded evidence. After agents complete, read all identified files and have the primary agent synthesize the current state, gaps, scope, and risks.

Update task: explore → completed, assess → in_progress.

### Step 4: Assess

Present to the user:
1. **Summary**: The issue in your own words
2. **Current state**: What exists today that's relevant
3. **Gaps**: What's missing, broken, or unclear
4. **Ambiguities**: Underspecified aspects or open questions
5. **Scope**: Size and complexity estimate
6. **Risks**: Pitfalls, edge cases, architectural concerns

### Step 5: Post assessment

Post as an issue comment:

```bash
GH_BODY="$(mktemp /tmp/gh-comment.$$.XXXXXXXX)"
cat > "$GH_BODY" << 'MACH6_EOF'
<!-- mach6-assessment -->
## Issue Assessment

<assessment content>

---
*Automated assessment by mach6*
MACH6_EOF
gh issue comment <number> --body-file "$GH_BODY"
```

Update task: post → completed.

Suggest next step: `/skill:mach6-plan <number>`

## CREATE Mode

**Create a new structured GitHub issue from context or description.**

### Step 1: Gather context

If a description was provided, use it as the starting point. Otherwise, ask the user what they want to create an issue for.

Check if the repository has issue templates:
```bash
ls .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ 2>/dev/null
```
If templates exist, read them and select the most appropriate one.

If codebase context is needed, use Explore subagents only for bounded evidence such as locating named behavior, files, tests, call sites, or exact snippets. The primary agent must interpret that evidence and own the issue's requirements, proposed behavior, scope, and technical conclusions.

### Step 2: Draft and approve the issue

An initial request to "create," "post," or "open" an issue is a request to draft it, **not approval to post it**. Never create an issue in the same turn as that initial request, regardless of how imperative or complete it is.

Create a structured issue with:
- **Title**: Clear, concise, action-oriented (under 80 chars, imperative form)
- **Original Request**: A clearly identified block quote containing the user's original request/input verbatim; do not paraphrase, correct, or omit any part of it
- **Summary**: 2-3 sentences describing the problem or feature
- **Current Behavior** (for bugs/improvements): What happens now
- **Proposed Behavior**: What should happen
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Bullet list of verifiable conditions that define "done"
- **Context**: Links to related PRs, issues, or discussions
- **Technical Notes**: Implementation hints, relevant files, architectural considerations
- **Labels**: Suggest appropriate labels based on the issue type

Keep the issue limited to what the user explicitly requested. Before adding any acceptance criterion that the user did not explicitly ask for, present the proposed criterion separately with `ask_user` and obtain explicit confirmation that it is valid scope. Do not include an unrequested criterion without that confirmation, and do not treat approval of the completed issue draft as retroactive scope confirmation.

Determine the candidate target repository as an exact `owner/repo`; do not rely on ambient `gh` context when posting. Use `ask_user` to present one Markdown-formatted approval question containing all of the following without summarizing or truncating them:
- The exact target `owner/repo`
- The complete issue title
- The complete Markdown issue body, including the verbatim **Original Request** block quote
- The complete proposed label list, or an explicit statement that no labels are proposed

The question must offer exactly these three options and allow free-text discussion:
- **Approve**
- **Deny/Discuss**
- **Detailed Explanation with minimal jargon of each acceptance criteria**

Only an explicit selection of **Approve** authorizes posting. Free text, a skipped or unanswered question, cancellation, **Deny/Discuss**, or the explanation option are not approval and must never fall through to issue creation.

If the user selects **Deny/Discuss**, discuss or revise the draft without posting. If the user requests the detailed explanation, explain every acceptance criterion with minimal jargon without posting. After either path, present the complete draft, target, and proposed labels through this approval gate again before posting. Any change to the title, body, target repository, or proposed labels invalidates prior approval and requires a fresh approval.

Stop and wait for the distinct `ask_user` response before continuing to Step 3. The non-interactive `gh` rule applies only to CLI execution; it does not replace this human approval gate.

### Step 3: Create the issue

Proceed only after the approval gate in Step 2 returned **Approve** for the exact title, body, target, and proposed labels used below.

```bash
GH_BODY="$(mktemp /tmp/gh-body.$$.XXXXXXXX)"
cat > "$GH_BODY" << 'MACH6_EOF'
<body>
MACH6_EOF
gh issue create --repo "<owner/repo>" --title "<title>" --body-file "$GH_BODY" [--label "<labels>"]
```

Report the issue number and URL. Suggest next step: `/skill:mach6-plan <number>`
