# mach6-issue — Assess or Create Issue

**User input:** $ARGUMENTS

## Global Rules

1. **GitHub as shared memory** — Plans, reviews, assessments, and progress are posted as PR/issue comments so any future session can pick up context.
2. **HTML markers** — Use `<!-- mach6-assessment -->`, `<!-- mach6-plan -->`, `<!-- mach6-review -->`, `<!-- mach6-progress -->` as the first line of comment bodies for reliable discovery.
3. **No `#N` in comment bodies** — GitHub auto-links `#N` to issues/PRs. Use "finding 3", "item 3", "stage 2" etc. instead.
4. **Safe git** — Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`. Stage files by name. Never stage secrets (.env, credentials, tokens, keys).
5. **Task tracking** — Use the `tasks_update` tool to show progress through multi-step commands.
6. **Project conventions** — Check for CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .dreb/CONTEXT.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md before planning or implementing.
7. **Non-interactive `gh`** — Set `GH_PAGER=cat` and `GH_EDITOR=cat` before all `gh` commands to prevent interactive prompts from hanging the agent. Use `--body-file` instead of inline `--body` for all `gh pr comment`, `gh pr create`, and `gh issue create` calls to avoid shell interpretation of backticks. Write each body to a **unique per-invocation temp file** via `mktemp` (e.g. `GH_BODY="$(mktemp /tmp/gh-comment.XXXXXX.md)"`) — never a fixed path like `/tmp/gh-comment.md`, which concurrent mach6 sessions on the same machine would clobber, cross-posting one session's body to another's PR/issue.

## Optional `context_mode` routing boundary

`context_mode` is available only through the optional, separately installed `dreb-context-mode` package. This guidance is advisory, not universal deterministic interception.

1. Start code discovery with `search`.
2. Use native tools for expected output of ≤2 KB; for 2–5 KB unless the work is clearly analytical; and for edits, verbatim, exact, or ordered facts, and Git/CI/version/release/publish evidence.
3. Use `context_mode` only for precise, large derived analysis or broad gathers expected to exceed 5 KB.
4. Treat its output as derived, not proof: directly verify material claims against source or bounded native evidence.
5. On an unavailable or failed call, show a bounded visible diagnostic, then continue natively; never silently fall back or report partial protocol output as success.
6. Never invoke `ctx_*` directly, arbitrary MCP methods, or a generic MCP client in core.
7. RTK is rejected due to fidelity, exit-code, and actionable-diagnostic failures.

## Required child handoff

When launching a child, repeat the routing boundary above and provide the exact task, a bounded file set or claim set, required direct verification, validation commands, and completion criteria. The child must use no direct `ctx_*` calls, arbitrary MCP methods, or a generic MCP client in core.

## Determine Mode

If the input is a number, run **ASSESS** mode. Otherwise, run **CREATE** mode.

## ASSESS Mode

**Assess an existing GitHub issue — explore the codebase, identify scope/risks/ambiguities, post assessment.**

### Step 1: Set up task tracking

```
tasks_update([
  { id: "read", title: "Read issue and comments", status: "in_progress" },
  { id: "explore", title: "Explore relevant codebase", status: "pending" },
  { id: "assess", title: "Analyze and assess", status: "pending" },
  { id: "post", title: "Post assessment", status: "pending" }
])
```

### Step 2: Read the issue

```bash
gh issue view <number>
gh issue view <number> --comments
```

Parse: problem statement, constraints, requirements, acceptance criteria, prior discussion, linked PRs.

Update task: read → completed, explore → in_progress.

### Step 3: Explore the codebase

Launch 2-3 Explore subagents in parallel targeting different aspects. Agent definitions specify their own model with a provider fallback list — defaults work across providers and are fine for most cases. Override only with good reason (e.g. a particularly complex issue warrants a stronger tier).
- **Relevant code**: Find existing code related to the issue, trace implementation patterns
- **Architecture**: Map relevant architecture layers, abstractions, data flow
- **Prior work**: Check for related branches, PRs, or commits

Each agent should return 5-10 key files. After agents complete, read all identified files.

Update task: explore → completed, assess → in_progress.

### Step 4: Assess

Present to the user:
1. **Summary**: The issue in your own words
2. **Current state**: What exists today that's relevant
3. **Gaps**: What's missing, broken, or unclear
4. **Ambiguities**: Underspecified aspects or open questions
5. **Scope**: Size and complexity estimate
6. **Risks**: Pitfalls, edge cases, architectural concerns

### Step 5: Post assessment

Post as an issue comment:

```bash
GH_BODY="$(mktemp /tmp/gh-comment.XXXXXX.md)"
cat > "$GH_BODY" << 'MACH6_EOF'
<!-- mach6-assessment -->
## Issue Assessment

<assessment content>

---
*Automated assessment by mach6*
MACH6_EOF
gh issue comment <number> --body-file "$GH_BODY"
```

Update task: post → completed.

Suggest next step: `/skill:mach6-plan <number>`

---

## CREATE Mode

**Create a new structured GitHub issue from context or description.**

### Step 1: Gather context

If a description was provided, use it as the starting point. Otherwise, ask the user what they want to create an issue for.

Check if the repository has issue templates:
```bash
ls .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ 2>/dev/null
```
If templates exist, read them and select the most appropriate one.

Explore the codebase if needed to understand the relevant area.

### Step 2: Draft the issue

Create a structured issue with:
- **Title**: Clear, concise, action-oriented (under 80 chars, imperative form)
- **Summary**: 2-3 sentences describing the problem or feature
- **Current Behavior** (for bugs/improvements): What happens now
- **Proposed Behavior**: What should happen
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Bullet list of verifiable conditions that define "done"
- **Context**: Links to related PRs, issues, or discussions
- **Technical Notes**: Implementation hints, relevant files, architectural considerations
- **Labels**: Suggest appropriate labels based on the issue type

Present the draft to the user for approval.

### Step 3: Create the issue

```bash
GH_BODY="$(mktemp /tmp/gh-body.XXXXXX.md)"
cat > "$GH_BODY" << 'MACH6_EOF'
<body>
MACH6_EOF
gh issue create --title "<title>" --body-file "$GH_BODY" [--label "<labels>"]
```

Report the issue number and URL. Suggest next step: `/skill:mach6-plan <number>`
