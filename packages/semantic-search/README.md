# @dreb/semantic-search

Semantic codebase search engine with embedding-based ranking, a bounded file-dependency graph, and an MCP server. Extracts and indexes code using tree-sitter for AST-aware chunking and a transformer embedding model ([all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)), then ranks results using 6-signal fusion via POEM.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 22+** — uses the built-in `node:sqlite` module

## Installation

```bash
npm install @dreb/semantic-search
```

## Claude Code Plugin

The package ships as a Claude Code plugin. Add the dreb marketplace and install:

```
/plugin marketplace add aebrer/dreb
/plugin install semantic-search@dreb
```

Or from the CLI outside a session:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add aebrer/dreb
claude plugin install semantic-search@dreb
```

Alternatively, register the MCP server directly without the plugin system:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio semantic-search -- npx @dreb/semantic-search semantic-search-mcp
```

For local development from a cloned repo:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./packages/semantic-search
```

## MCP Server

The package exposes a `search` tool over the Model Context Protocol (stdio transport). The tool accepts:

| Parameter    | Required | Description                                      |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `query`      | yes      | Natural language, identifier, or path query       |
| `searchDir` | yes      | Directory to index and search — each unique value gets its own independent index |
| `restrictToDir` | no       | Filter results to files under this path within the already-built index (does not affect indexing) |
| `limit`      | no       | Maximum results to return (default: 20)           |
| `rebuild`    | no       | Force a clean index rebuild (default: false)      |

Start the server standalone:

```bash
npx @dreb/semantic-search semantic-search-mcp
```

## How Ranking Works

Results are ranked by fusing 6 independent signals using **POEM** (Pareto-Optimal Embedded Modeling) weights that vary per query type:

| Signal                | Description                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BM25**              | Keyword matching via FTS5 full-text search                     |
| **Cosine similarity** | Embedding-based semantic similarity using all-MiniLM-L6-v2    |
| **Path match**        | Query terms appearing in the file path                         |
| **Symbol match**      | Query terms matching function, class, or type names            |
| **Import graph**      | Proximity to high-scoring files in the import/dependency graph |
| **Git recency**       | Recently modified files ranked higher                          |

Queries are automatically classified as _identifier_, _natural language_, or _path_ queries, and each type applies different POEM column weights. POEM constructs a Pareto front over all signal dimensions and assigns ranks based on dominance depth — no manual weight tuning required. See [Pareto-Optimal Embedded Modeling](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ab891b) for the theoretical foundation.

## Library API

```typescript
import { SearchEngine } from "@dreb/semantic-search";

const engine = new SearchEngine("/path/to/project", {
  indexDir: "/custom/index/path",         // default: <projectRoot>/.search-index
  globalMemoryDir: "~/.dreb/memory",      // additional directory to index
  modelCacheDir: "~/.cache/models",       // default: ~/.cache/semantic-search/models
  visibleDirs: (root) => [`${root}/.special`], // extra dirs (bypasses .gitignore)
});

// First call builds the index (10-60s); subsequent calls are fast
const results = await engine.search("where is auth handled", {
  limit: 20,
  pathFilter: "src/",
  onProgress: (phase, current, total) => console.log(`${phase}: ${current}/${total}`),
});

const dependencies = await engine.dependencyGraph("src/auth/middleware.ts", {
  direction: "both", // dependencies, dependents, or both
  depth: 2,          // bounded to 1-3 hops
  limit: 30,         // bounded to 1-100 related files
});

const stats = engine.getStats();    // { files, chunks } | null
await engine.resetIndex();          // delete index, next search rebuilds
await engine.close();               // dispose resources
SearchEngine.isAvailable();         // check for node:sqlite
```

## Dependency Graph

`dependencyGraph()` traverses the file-import relationships already stored by the search index. It performs deterministic breadth-first traversal, supports dependencies, dependents, or both directions, and is bounded to three hops and 100 results. In `both` mode, a mutual import is returned once with the `imports_and_imported_by` relationship. Structural-only calls skip embedding generation; a later semantic search fills missing vectors on demand.

This graph is deliberately narrower than a call graph. It is derived from static imports and may omit dynamic imports, reflection, generated code, framework wiring, and unresolved package aliases. Treat it as navigation evidence and verify runtime claims in source and tests.

## What Gets Indexed

- **Code** — tree-sitter AST chunks (functions, classes, methods, interfaces, etc.). TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++, GDScript.
- **Text** — Markdown (by heading), YAML/TOML (by key), JSON, plaintext (by paragraph). Also indexes Godot scene (`.tscn`), resource (`.tres`), and project (`.godot`) files as plaintext.
- **Extra directories** — via `globalMemoryDir` or `visibleDirs`, scanned even if gitignored.

The index is stored in `.search-index/search.db` at the project root (add `.search-index/` to `.gitignore`).
