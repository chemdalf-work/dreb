 * Root Vitest configuration.

 * Defines which packages participate in the vitest workspace, so that running

 * `npx vitest --run packages/dashboard`) respects each package's own
 * vitest.config.ts.

 * The `packages/tui` package is excluded because it uses node:test, not vitest.
 * Running vitest against its test files produces "No test suite found in file"
 * failures (see issue #89).
