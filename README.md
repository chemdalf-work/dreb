# dreb

dreb is a hackable, open-source terminal coding agent and agent runtime for people who want to own their AI development workflow. It gives you a practical coding assistant today — tools, sessions, memory, model switching, subagents, and a polished TUI — while keeping the core flexible enough to reshape with skills, extensions, packages, custom providers, and alternate frontends. Its web dashboard puts every agent session in the browser: start work at your desk, steer it from your phone.

Use dreb if you want a coding agent that can run against direct APIs, coding subscriptions, proxies, cloud providers, local models, or your own provider code; if you want workflows such as issue-to-merge automation and multi-agent review to be inspectable and replaceable; or if you want an agent runtime you can embed in a CLI, an RPC process, an SDK integration, a web dashboard, or a Telegram bot.

## Why choose dreb?

- **Every session, on every device.** The [web dashboard](#web-dashboard) is a first-party browser UI for the same sessions the terminal runs: a fleet overview of all live and past sessions across projects, full chat with steering, live subagent observability, host file access, and settings — one synchronized state on desktop and mobile. Local-only by default; remote access is Tailscale-gated with device pairing.
- **Model and provider freedom.** Authenticate with API keys or `/login` subscriptions, switch models at runtime with `/model`, scope model sets, tune thinking levels, route built-in providers through proxies, use cloud providers such as Bedrock/Vertex/Azure, or add local/proxy/custom models through [Custom Models](packages/coding-agent/docs/models.md) and [Custom Providers](packages/coding-agent/docs/custom-provider.md). See [Providers](packages/coding-agent/docs/providers.md) for the current setup list.
- **A real development workflow.** [mach6](packages/coding-agent/docs/mach6.md) is a built-in issue-to-merge workflow: assess issues, plan work, open draft PRs, implement, push progress, run multi-agent reviews, independently assess findings, fix CI or review items, and publish. Plans, reviews, and progress live on GitHub as shared memory.
- **Composable agent building blocks.** [Skills](packages/coding-agent/docs/skills.md) are markdown workflows loaded on demand; [extensions](packages/coding-agent/docs/extensions.md) are TypeScript modules for custom tools, commands, event hooks, UI components, renderers, keybindings, provider registration, permission gates, and workflow automation; [packages](packages/coding-agent/docs/packages.md) bundle skills, extensions, prompts, and themes for npm, git, or local sharing.
- **Parallel and specialized agents.** The `subagent` tool runs independent child agents in single, parallel, or chain mode. Custom agent definitions can inherit models, record child-session metadata for audit trails, and power workflows such as mach6's specialized reviewers. Per-agent models and per-request thinking remain explicit controls. The built-in [`model-routing-guide` skill](packages/coding-agent/docs/skills.md#model-routing-guide) researches scoped provider/model candidates and local child history, and its `update` mode preserves retained entries while removing stale scope and researching newly added models; the optional global-only [Dispatch Arbiter](packages/coding-agent/docs/agent-models.md#dispatch-arbiter) consumes that guide in a fully headless, tool-less call before every child spawn. Host-side coding-risk classification, derived lean/full tool profiles, and live candidate price/capability metadata guide cost-aware decisions without treating unknown prices as free or lowering high-risk quality solely for cost. Explicit per-call agent, model, and thinking choices remain locked. Its bounded rolling parent activity follows the title setter and includes useful tool outputs, with existing secret scrubbing applied before inference. It is disabled by default and fails closed—bad configuration, guide, inference, or decisions prevent the child from spawning rather than silently keeping the original route. TUI `/settings` and dashboard Settings expose its enable toggle, exact model, thinking, guide path, and validation/readiness feedback. Typed decisions are persisted and visible in the TUI, JSON/RPC, and dashboard. While background subagents run, a separate guardrail pauses the parent after a few turns, configurable via [`backgroundAgents`](packages/coding-agent/docs/settings.md#background-agents).
- **Durable context.** [Sessions](packages/coding-agent/docs/session.md) are JSONL trees with resume/continue, `/tree` navigation, `/fork`, CLI `--fork`, compaction, HTML export, and JSONL import/export. [Memory](packages/coding-agent/README.md#memory) is file-based, global + project-scoped, survives sessions, can read Claude Code project memory, and can be maintained with `/dream` memory consolidation.
- **A capable terminal workspace.** The TUI supports slash commands, file references with `@`, path completion, image paste/drag, bash shortcuts, hotkeys, settings, model cycling, steering/follow-up queues while the agent is working, token/cost/context status, custom themes, and extension-provided UI surfaces. Transcript prose, code, tool output, and agent results use terminal soft-wrap so copying from scrollback keeps long logical lines intact instead of injecting hard newlines.
- **Optional local companion.** [`/buddy`](packages/coding-agent/docs/buddy.md) hatches an Ollama-powered terminal companion with persistent state, generated personality/backstory, event reactions, idle quips, name-call responses, pet/reroll/stats commands, and a sidebar presence while you work.
- **Codebase and web understanding.** dreb includes file, grep/find/ls, bash, web search/fetch, task tracking, skill invocation, and semantic `search`. Semantic search uses AST-aware chunks, embeddings, POEM ranking, memory indexing, and also ships as [`@dreb/semantic-search`](packages/semantic-search/) with an MCP server for other harnesses. The semantic search package requires Node.js 22+.
- **Detailed usage tracking and performance logging.** dreb records per-session token usage, cost, context-window utilization, and rolling tokens-per-second performance in a local JSONL log (`~/.dreb/agent/performance.jsonl`). Session JSONL trees also provide same-local-day cost accounting across main sessions and all descendant subagents. The TUI footer separates the current session's `main` and `children` costs from the all-session `today` total, shows a hierarchical per-child breakdown, and emits warning-only notices at $50, $100, and every additional $50 without stopping work. This data stays on your machine and can also be queried through Telegram `/stats` or RPC for personal analytics and model comparison.
- **Safety and reliability primitives.** Recent dreb-specific hardening includes secret output scrubbing, sensitive-file guards, destructive-command guards, resource diagnostics surfaced in-session, warning propagation, rate-limited web search across parallel subagents, and JSON/RPC protocol hardening. Dropped provider streams are retried (discarding the partial), and responses truncated at the model's output-token limit are retried with a larger token budget — failing loudly rather than returning a silently empty or truncated result.
- **Multiple interfaces.** Run dreb as an interactive TUI, print/headless CLI, JSON event stream, RPC process, embedded [SDK](packages/coding-agent/docs/sdk.md), [web dashboard](packages/coding-agent/docs/dashboard.md), or [Telegram bot](packages/telegram/).

## Quick Start

> **Node.js 22 LTS is required.** dreb relies on SSE streaming behavior that is stable in Node 22 LTS. Node 24 and Node 26 are known to break provider streaming due to changes in ReadableStream buffering, which causes every provider to fail with **"request ended without sending any chunks"**. If you see that error, switch to Node 22 LTS.

### Building from source (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aebrer/dreb.git
cd dreb
npm install
npm run build
npm link -w packages/coding-agent
```

See the full coding-agent docs in [packages/coding-agent](packages/coding-agent/).

### Installing from npm

```bash
npm install -g @dreb/coding-agent
```

Authenticate with an API key and start the TUI:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
dreb
```

Or use a coding subscription such as ChatGPT/Codex, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, or Kimi:

```bash
dreb
/login
```

Or route through a custom provider — corporate proxy, OpenAI-compatible local server such as Ollama/LM Studio/vLLM, Bedrock proxy, Anthropic-compatible endpoint, Google-compatible endpoint, or extension-registered provider. See [Custom Models](packages/coding-agent/docs/models.md) and [Providers](packages/coding-agent/docs/providers.md).

Platform notes: [Windows](packages/coding-agent/docs/windows.md), [Termux/Android](packages/coding-agent/docs/termux.md), [tmux](packages/coding-agent/docs/tmux.md), [terminal setup](packages/coding-agent/docs/terminal-setup.md), and [shell aliases](packages/coding-agent/docs/shell-aliases.md).

**Bun users:** Bun's lockfile can cache stale versions of `@dreb/*` packages, causing import errors after upgrades. If you hit missing export errors with `bunx dreb`, clear the cache and re-install:

```bash
bun pm cache rm
bunx --force dreb
```

### Troubleshooting

- **"request ended without sending any chunks" on every provider** — Your Node version is likely too new. Switch to **Node.js 22 LTS**. Node 26 in particular changed ReadableStream buffering in a way that breaks the Anthropic and OpenAI SDK stream parsers dreb uses.

## Core capabilities

### Tools and interaction

dreb ships with 13 built-in tools: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `subagent`, `wait`, `search` (semantic codebase search), and `ask_user` (pause and ask the user a structured multiple-choice or free-text question with Markdown-formatted question text and an in-card Stop agent action, rendered natively in the TUI and Dashboard). Two more tools are always active: `skill` for loading workflows, and `tasks_update` for visible task tracking. `suggest_next` (ghost text command suggestions, Tab to accept) is active by default but excluded when `--tools` is specified.

Interactive mode adds slash commands such as `/model`, `/settings`, `/resume`, `/tree`, `/fork`, `/compact`, `/dream`, `/buddy`, `/export`, `/reload`, and `/hotkeys`. The message queue lets you steer a running agent or queue follow-up work without waiting for the current turn to finish.

### Provider and model routing

dreb supports both subscription and API-key providers, with model metadata updated in releases. Current provider docs cover subscriptions such as Codex, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and Kimi; API-key providers such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini/Vertex, Amazon Bedrock, Mistral, Groq, Cerebras, xAI, OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, ZAI, OpenCode, Hugging Face, Kimi, and MiniMax; plus custom local/proxy providers.

Custom model configuration can override built-in provider base URLs, merge custom models into built-in providers, set compatibility flags for OpenAI-compatible servers, resolve API keys from shell commands or environment variables, select Bearer-only auth for Anthropic-compatible endpoints, and register providers dynamically from extensions.

When switching models, dreb replays exact-model signed, encrypted, or redacted reasoning state unchanged. Portable structured reasoning is limited to models on the same provider using the OpenAI Chat Completions API when the destination accepts the source's recognized plain field (`reasoning_content`, `reasoning`, or `reasoning_text`); other readable reasoning is carried as labelled plaintext, while opaque redacted or encrypted-only state is not sent to incompatible targets. Provider identity and signature compatibility matter for custom models as well. Switching changes only the outbound request, so returning to the original model can replay its original state unless history has been compacted or pruned.

Provider-specific docs include Kimi vision notes that distinguish the Kimi Code OAuth endpoint, the Kimi API-key coding provider, first-party Kimi CLI media handling, and Moonshot Open Platform vision support.

### Workflows and customization

Skills provide progressively loaded instructions for specialized tasks. They can be invoked by users as `/skill:name` or by the model through the `skill` tool, support argument substitution, and can live globally, per-project, in packages, or on the CLI.

Extensions are TypeScript modules loaded with full access to dreb's extension API. They can add or override tools, intercept tool calls, mutate provider payloads, add commands and flags, define custom keyboard shortcuts, render custom tool output, open overlays and custom editors, persist state in sessions, register providers, surface warnings, and implement custom permission or workflow gates.

Resources carry source provenance so commands, tools, skills, and prompts can be traced through autocomplete, RPC discovery, and SDK introspection.

dreb packages make those resources installable and shareable through npm, git, URLs, or local paths. Use `dreb install`, `dreb list`, `dreb update`, and `dreb config` to manage them; project-local packages can be checked into settings so teams get the same skills, extensions, prompts, and themes.

### Optional context-efficient analysis

The separately maintained [`dreb-context-mode`](https://github.com/chemdalf-work/dreb-context-mode) package adds advisory, context-efficient analysis routing without adding a generic MCP client to dreb's core. Install it once:

```bash
dreb install git:github.com/chemdalf-work/dreb-context-mode
```

After installation, normal main sessions and subagents discover the package automatically; users do not repeatedly invoke a skill or `ctx_*` command. Its guidance starts code discovery with semantic `search`, keeps small, exact, ordered, edit, Git/CI/version/release/publish evidence native, and reserves `context_mode` for precise large derived analysis or broad gathers. It is advisory rather than universal deterministic interception, and material derived claims still require direct source or bounded native verification. A failed call shows a bounded visible diagnostic before native continuation; it never silently falls back or treats partial protocol output as success.

This is external package code, not an OS sandbox: its child process has the dreb user's filesystem, network, executable, and other OS privileges. Operations that index data persist it only in the package's dreb-owned local storage, with project isolation, retention, removal, and abandoned-directory pruning documented by the [package](https://github.com/chemdalf-work/dreb-context-mode); dreb core remains without a generic MCP client. Review the package before installing it. RTK is intentionally not integrated because fidelity, exit-code, and actionable-diagnostic failures made automatic interception unsafe.

### Sessions, memory, and continuity

Sessions are persistent JSONL files with a tree structure. You can resume recent sessions, browse past sessions, branch in-place with `/tree`, fork sessions into new files, compact long conversations, import/export JSONL, export HTML, or choose a custom session directory.

Memory is just files. Global and project memory indexes are loaded into the system prompt at startup, and entries can store user preferences, good practices, project context, or navigation pointers. `/dream` backs up memory, merges duplicates, scans recent sessions for unrecorded patterns, prunes stale entries, and validates links.

At startup, dreb always loads project context files (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) by walking **upward** from its launch cwd. This initial upward scan is separate from, and not controlled by, nested-context trust settings. Lazy nested/out-of-cwd loading is **off by default**: when a tool later enters a subdirectory or another repo, its context is loaded only if that canonical directory is covered by a global trusted root in `~/.dreb/agent/settings.json` (`context.trustedFolders`). Trust a root only when you control its instructions; it covers that root and descendants after realpath resolution, so a symlink escaping the root is not trusted. In the dashboard, the Files view is the primary flow to grant or remove folder trust, while Settings lists every configured root for audit/revoke and offers add-by-path. `context.autoLoadNested: true` is a global-only expert trust-all override and can inject prompt-injection content from any resolvable directory. Project `.dreb/settings.json` cannot enable, disable, or extend nested-context trust, so a cloned repository cannot grant itself trust. Main agents and subagents use the same global decision. Auto-loaded content is secret-scrubbed and appended after extension `tool_result` transforms, which intentionally do not see it; paths are deduplicated so each file is injected at most once per session. See [Context Files](packages/coding-agent/README.md#context-files).

### Interfaces and embedding

The same agent runtime powers multiple surfaces:

- **Interactive TUI** — the default terminal coding workspace.
- **Print/headless CLI** — `dreb -p` for one-shot prompts, including piped stdin.
- **JSON mode** — event stream for scripts and automation.
- **RPC mode** — strict [JSONL stdin/stdout protocol](packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md) for non-Node clients and custom UIs.
- **SDK** — import `@dreb/coding-agent` and create agent sessions directly in TypeScript.
- **Telegram** — `@dreb/telegram` runs dreb as a bot with sessions, model controls, file upload/download, live tool status, and visible results for user-facing tools.
- **Web dashboard** — `dreb dashboard` serves a browser UI (fleet overview of all sessions, full chat with steering, subagent observability, host file browser); local-only by default, remote via Tailscale + rotating pairing code. See [dashboard docs](packages/coding-agent/docs/dashboard.md).

### Web dashboard

The dashboard is the visual face of dreb: every agent session on the host, live in the browser, with the same fidelity as the terminal.

**One host, every screen.** The dashboard server and the TUI share the same sessions on disk and the same agent runtime. Start a refactor in the terminal, open the dashboard on your desktop to watch its subagents fan out, then pick the same session up from your phone on the couch — one synchronized state everywhere, streaming live over SSE. The layout is responsive by design: on a desktop it's a dense multi-column fleet; on a phone, fleet cards stack and their content wraps instead of overflowing, while the session view prioritizes read-and-steer because steering a running agent from wherever you are is the point.

<!-- screenshot: fleet overview, desktop (light) -->
<!-- screenshot: session view, mobile -->

**Fleet overview.** Home base is every session across every project: live sessions with status chips (running / needs-attention / idle / error), activity lines, running subagents, task progress, context usage, and model — plus past sessions grouped by project, resumable with one tap. Terminal provider/API failures show their reason on the fleet card; transient failures clear that terminal card state when automatic retry begins. Live cards update through compact SSE snapshots instead of re-fetching the full cross-project inventory on every turn, keeping weak mobile links responsive. When a session needs input, the browser tab badges and (opt-in) sends a service-worker notification (installable PWA, works on Android and iOS). For opt-in local mobile transport profiling, see the [dashboard docs](packages/coding-agent/docs/dashboard.md#mobile-transport-profiling).

**Full-parity session view.** Not a reduced chat client: streaming markdown, thinking blocks, bespoke tool cards (read/write/edit/bash and markdown-rendering tools), sanitized inline PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP images returned by any tool, task panels, queued-message chips, image attach/paste with sent-image transcript previews, slash-command autocomplete, model/thinking switchers, fork-from-message, HTML export. Provider/API failures render inline on the failed assistant attempt with any partial output preserved, including after refresh or recovery; transient failures then switch the session status to retrying without erasing that history. Tool-result images remain visible to the human even when the active model is text-only. While the agent works you can **steer** (inject into the running turn), **queue follow-ups**, or **stop** — the same queue semantics as the TUI.

**Low-data transcript images.** Tool results and images uploaded with user turns remain visible through content-addressed browser references rather than full base64 in events and transcript JSON. The default browser-local mode lazily requests a preview bounded to 1024 × 1024 and 256 KiB; clicking enlarges that same preview without downloading the original. Settings also offers request-free placeholders and informed-opt-in automatic originals. Explicit originals disclose their size and confirm above 1 MiB. Authenticated same-origin routes accept only signature-matching PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP, send `nosniff`, and recover evicted entries from authoritative session data; static GIF previews preserve animated originals behind the original route. Image bytes therefore cannot cause an SSE oversized-event resync. Full-resolution HTML exports remain self-contained and unchanged.

<!-- screenshot: session view with tool cards + subagent strip, desktop (dark) -->

**Live subagent observability.** Background subagents are first-class: chips on the parent session, live counts on fleet cards, and a read-only drill-in transcript per agent that streams in real time and survives browser reloads. When the Dispatch Arbiter is enabled, those views also show its host-validated changed, unchanged, or failed pre-spawn decision and the final routed agent/model/thinking—never raw arbiter output.

**Live connection recovery.** The top bar and persistent session header have an accessible, text-labelled connection indicator (connecting, connected, retrying, resyncing, disconnected, or auth failed). SSE uses bounded replay and an authoritative snapshot barrier to recover from browser reloads, server restarts, sequence gaps, slow-client backpressure, and stalls without duplicating state; task lists restore with the session snapshot. Named 25-second heartbeats and a foreground 60-second liveness watchdog detect a stuck stream. See [dashboard recovery details](packages/coding-agent/docs/dashboard.md#live-connection-and-recovery) and the [RPC ordering contract](packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md#get_dashboard_snapshot).

**Host files, explicitly.** Browse the host filesystem, upload/download, create folders, and start a new session in any directory — every file operation logged server-side.

**Curated appearance themes.** A theme gallery in settings offers eight dashboard-native themes (entropist.ca, Dim, Solarized, Gruvbox, Caves of Qud, Van Gogh, plus the colorblind-safe Okabe-Ito and Paul Tol palettes), each with its own light and dark palette, plus a system/light/dark mode toggle. Choices are saved per browser and are independent of your TUI theme.

Launch locally:

```bash
dreb dashboard
# or: dreb-dashboard
```

**Remote access is explicit and Tailscale-only.** There is no LAN mode and no public exposure. Local mode binds loopback exclusively (with Host/Origin validation against DNS rebinding). Remote mode requires [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) — from your phone on the same WiFi or from the other side of the world, the path is identical:

```bash
dreb-dashboard --remote --allow you@example.com
```

Every remote request passes fail-closed layers: tailnet identity resolution, identity allowlist (empty list denies everyone), first-login pairing with a rotating 6-digit code shown only on the host, then a signed device cookie. Paired devices are listed in settings and can be unpaired at any time. Pairing grants terminal-equivalent power — the pairing screen says so before the code is entered.

**Installable PWA + mobile notifications.** The dashboard is an installable web app — add it to the home screen on Android Chrome or iOS Safari 16.4+ for a standalone, no-URL-bar experience. Needs-attention notifications go through the service worker (`registration.showNotification`) — the only path that works on Android (which removed the page Notification constructor) and on iOS (installed PWA only). For remote access from a phone, notifications and the service worker require a **secure context** (HTTPS), so the dashboard can terminate TLS itself using `tailscale cert` files — no reverse proxy, and the auth model is unchanged (the peer address stays the real tailnet IP):

```bash
dreb-dashboard --remote --allow you@example.com \
  --https --cert /etc/dreb/cert.pem --key /etc/dreb/key.pem
```

Local mode (`http://127.0.0.1`) already qualifies as a secure context, so install and notifications work there with no TLS setup. See the [dashboard docs](packages/coding-agent/docs/dashboard.md) for the one-time `tailscale cert` setup and renewal walkthrough.

For auto-restart on Linux, install a systemd user unit. Use the absolute path from `which dreb-dashboard` for `ExecStart` (the example below matches an npm global prefix under `~/.npm-global`):

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/dreb-dashboard.service
[Unit]
Description=dreb web dashboard

[Service]
ExecStart=%h/.npm-global/bin/dreb-dashboard
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now dreb-dashboard
```

macOS users can run the same command under a launchd user agent; a full plist is deferred.

**WSL2 users:** if you reach the dashboard from a Windows browser and hit an intermittent access-denied / pairing screen on `http://127.0.0.1` after the WSL VM has been idle, see the [WSL2 gotcha](packages/coding-agent/docs/dashboard.md#wsl2-gotcha) for the cause and keep-alive workarounds.

## Design philosophy

dreb is a hard fork of [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), itself derived from Claude Code. Claude Code is a great product; dreb is not trying to win by cloning every feature into a bigger built-in core. It is trying to win on control, hackability, provider choice, and inspectable workflows.

That means some features other tools bake in are intentionally left as user-space building blocks:

- **No built-in MCP client in the core.** Prefer CLI tools with clear READMEs, skills, or extensions. Separately, `@dreb/semantic-search` exposes an MCP server for other harnesses.
- **No mandatory permission-popup system.** Run in a container, rely on dreb's guards, or build the confirmation flow you want with extensions.
- **No separate plan mode primitive.** Write plans to files or GitHub, use mach6, install a package, or build your own planning UI with extensions.
- **No background bash in the main agent.** The main agent runs shell commands synchronously; parallel work belongs in subagents.

The tradeoff is a smaller core with stronger escape hatches: markdown skills, TypeScript extensions, custom agents, custom providers, installable packages, and multiple frontends.

## Why fork?

A hard fork means dreb controls the update cadence. Upstream changes do not land automatically; useful fixes can be cherry-picked, product direction can diverge, and dreb-specific work such as mach6, memory maintenance, Telegram, safety guards, and provider routing can evolve on its own schedule.

See [FORK.md](FORK.md) for details.
