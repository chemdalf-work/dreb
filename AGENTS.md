# AGENTS.md — dreb Development Guide

## Build Requirement

**You MUST run `npm run build` after ANY code change before testing with the real `dreb` binary.** The CLI runs compiled JS from `dist/`, not TypeScript source. Vitest transpiles TS on the fly, so tests will pass even with a stale build — but manual testing against the binary will use old code.

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds all packages in dependency order: tui → ai → agent → semantic-search → coding-agent → telegram → dashboard.

`npm run build` is a **pure compile step** — it does not bump versions or touch `package-lock.json`. Version syncing is a separate, explicit release operation (`npm run sync-version`); see Release Protocol below. CI enforces this: a build that mutates `package-lock.json` fails the lint/type-check job.

## Node & npm Toolchain

- **Node:** `22.x` (enforced via `engines.node` in every workspace `package.json`, plus `.nvmrc` / `.node-version`). The Node 22 line bundles npm 10.x — that's what local dev and the CI `check`/`test` jobs run, and what generated the committed `package-lock.json`.
- **`packageManager` pin:** the root `package.json` pins `packageManager: npm@11.5.1`. This deliberately matches the version the **publish** workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) upgrades to, because npm trusted publishing (OIDC provenance) requires npm ≥ 11.5.1. Keep these two in lockstep: if you bump one, bump the other.
- **Publish workflow ordering matters:** the publish job runs `npm ci` + `npm run build` on the stock npm 10.x bundled with Node 22, and only *then* upgrades to npm 11.5.1 for the `npm publish` steps. Running `npm ci` under npm 11.5.1 silently skips platform-specific optional dependencies that the lockfile marks `optional: true, peer: true` (e.g. `@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`, needed by vite/rollup for the dashboard build), which breaks the build. Do not move the npm upgrade above install/build.
- **Why the npm 10 (dev/install) vs npm 11.5.1 (publish-only) split is safe:** `npm publish` does not touch `package-lock.json`, and installs always run under npm 10.x — the same toolchain that generated the committed lockfile. Lockfile changes only ever come from an intentional `npm install`.

## Monorepo Structure

- `packages/ai` — Model registry, provider APIs, types
- `packages/agent` — Core agent loop, event system, types
- `packages/coding-agent` — CLI tool, tools, model resolution, TUI
- `packages/long-horizon` — Durable SDK supervisor, run journal, recovery, and autonomous CLI
- `packages/tui` — Terminal UI components
- `packages/telegram` — Telegram bot integration
- `packages/semantic-search` — Semantic codebase search engine + MCP server
- `packages/dashboard` — Web dashboard (Express server + SolidJS client over RPC)

## Workspace Link Safety

npm v9 changed `install-links` to default `true`. This causes local workspace packages to be packed and installed as stale tarball copies instead of symlinked. When this happens you get silent, hard-to-debug failures because nested `node_modules/@dreb/*` directories contain outdated published code instead of your local workspace source.

**How we made it safe:**
- `.npmrc` at repo root sets `install-links=false`

With this protection in place, `npm install` and `npm ci` will correctly symlink local workspace packages. (The `workspace:*` protocol would be even better, but it is currently broken in npm 11 — see npm/cli#8845.)

Verify workspace links are healthy before declaring a build good:

```bash
npm run verify-workspace-links
```

If it reports stale packages, remove the stale directories and re-establish workspace symlinks locally.

## Release Protocol

**Every release MUST follow these steps in order. No exceptions.**

**The version bump happens on the feature branch, BEFORE merge.** The default branch (master) requires PRs for all changes — you cannot push commits directly to it.

1. **Bump version**: Update `version` in the root `package.json` (on the feature branch)
2. **Sync**: Run `npm run sync-version`. This propagates the root version to all `packages/*/package.json`, plugin manifests, and the workspace `version` fields in `package-lock.json`. It does **not** re-resolve dependencies. (`npm run build` no longer does this for you — syncing is now an explicit step.)
3. **Build**: Run `npm run build` to compile with the new version
4. **Verify**: Launch the binary and confirm the TUI welcome message shows the correct version
5. **Commit & push**: Commit **all** version-bumped files and push to the feature branch. The sync script prints the full list, but at minimum: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, all `packages/*/package.json`, and any `packages/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
6. **Merge**: Merge the PR (squash) after CI passes
7. **Tag**: On the default branch after merge: `git tag v<version> && git push --tags`

**The version in `package.json` is the source of truth.** The TUI reads it at runtime via `config.ts`. If the version in `package.json` doesn't match the release, the TUI will show the wrong version to users.

**Never create a git tag without first bumping `package.json` to match.**

## Documentation

**The root `README.md` is the most important documentation file in this repo.** It is the first thing users and contributors see. When features, tools, or capabilities change, the root README must be updated alongside `packages/coding-agent/README.md` and any relevant files in `packages/coding-agent/docs/`. Do not assume that updating package-level docs is sufficient — if the root README describes the feature, it must stay accurate.

Documentation files to check on every feature change:
- `README.md` (root — the public face of the project)
- `packages/coding-agent/README.md` (detailed product docs)
- `packages/coding-agent/docs/` (feature-specific docs: extensions, json, rpc, sdk, etc.)
- `AGENTS.md` (this file — development guide)

## Nested Context Trust Boundary

The initial startup scan still walks upward from the main or subagent launch cwd and is separate from lazy nested/out-of-cwd loading. Lazy loading defaults **off**. Its global-only policy lives in `~/.dreb/agent/settings.json`: `context.trustedFolders` grants canonical existing roots and descendants, with native-realpath matching that denies symlink escapes. Project `.dreb/settings.json` cannot add or override trusted roots or enable loading.

`context.autoLoadNested: true` is a global-only expert trust-all override, not a normal per-project setting. It allows any resolvable target's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` to be injected and therefore crosses a prompt-injection trust boundary. Prefer explicit trusted roots. Main and subagent processes use the same policy and observe changes for future lazy loads; already injected context cannot be removed. Lazy injected content remains secret-scrubbed, ordered after extension `tool_result` transforms, and deduplicated per session.

## Completeness Rule

**Don't defer parts of categorical work.** If the task is "fix docs," fix ALL docs — don't cherry-pick the easy ones and punt the rest to a follow-up. Same applies to failing tests and discovered bugs: if you find it during the work, fix it now. "Out of scope" is not an excuse to ship known-broken things.

## No Ignoring Pre-Existing Failures

**There is no such thing as a "pre-existing" test or lint failure that's okay to ignore.** If a test fails or a linter complains — whether it's in files you touched or not — it gets fixed. No bypassing with `--no-verify`, no rationalizing that it's "unrelated," no deferring to a future PR. If CI would fail on it, it's your problem now.

## UI Ordering — Determinism Over Recency

**Lists of live/long-lived UI cards (fleet sessions, agent strips, etc.) must sort deterministically, not by dynamic activity.** Order by a stable key (e.g. project path alphabetical, then session start time as tiebreak) so cards keep a fixed position. Sorting by `lastActivity` or other constantly-changing signals makes cards jump around on every event — consistency is better UX than dynamic reordering. When a new ordering dimension is needed, add a stable field (like `createdAt`) rather than reusing a mutable one.

## Testing

```bash
npm test          # Run all workspace tests
npx vitest --run packages/coding-agent/test/some.test.ts  # Single file
```

Linting:

```bash
npx biome check --write <files>
```
