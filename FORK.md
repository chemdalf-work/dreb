# Fork Documentation

## Current fork source
- **Product:** Pierre Dreb
- **Repository:** https://github.com/chemdalf-work/pierre-dreb
- **Upstream baseline:** https://github.com/aebrer/dreb at `52583b0` (`v2.66.0`)
- **Compatibility retained:** `@dreb/*`, `~/.dreb`, project `.dreb`, `DREB_*`, and the temporary `dreb` command

## Original source
- **Repository:** https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono
- **Commit:** `fb10d9aef9c9f0b84e690482f044250c6fc2ce49`

## What was removed
- `packages/mom/` — Slack bot (we're building Telegram via Carcin instead)
- `packages/pods/` — vLLM GPU pod management (not needed)
- `packages/web-ui/` — Web UI components (may revisit later)
- `packages/web-ui/example` workspace entry
- Release/publish/version scripts (we manage releases ourselves)
- Profile scripts, browser-smoke check (web-ui specific)

## What was kept
- `packages/ai/` — LLM provider abstraction (18+ adapters, OAuth) → `@dreb/ai`
- `packages/agent/` — Agent runtime, transport, state management → `@dreb/agent-core`
- `packages/tui/` — Terminal UI with differential rendering → `@dreb/tui`
- `packages/coding-agent/` — CLI, tools, extensions, sessions → `@dreb/coding-agent`

## Rebranding
- Canonical CLI command: `pi` → `dreb` → `pierre-dreb`
- Display identity: **Pierre Dreb**
- Temporary compatibility command: `dreb` (same compiled entry point as `pierre-dreb`)
- Config directory: `.pi/` → `.dreb/` (retained)
- Package names: `@mariozechner/pi-*` → `@dreb/*` (retained)
- Environment prefix: `DREB_*` (retained)
- Config key: `piConfig` → `drebConfig` in package.json; product and compatibility fields are now independent

## Maintenance policy
This is a hard fork, not a tracking fork. We maintain independently.
Cherry-pick from upstream when something useful lands, after reading the diff.
